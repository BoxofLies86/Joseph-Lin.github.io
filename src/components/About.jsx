                I'm Joseph Lin, a Computer Science major at NYU Tandon School of
                Engineering, with minors in Business Studies and Math. My
                academic journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in
                areas like Data Structures, Computer Networking, and Software
                Engineering. As part of my passion for innovation, I've
                developed a GPT-4-powered fitness application with Streamlit,
                designed databases with MySQL, and implemented secure web
                frameworks like Flask. I've also delved into low-level
                programming by simulating processor architectures in C++,
                showcasing both my technical skills and analytical mindset.
              </p>
              <p>
                Beyond academics, I thrive in collaborative and creative
                environments. I've taken on leadership roles in music ensembles,
                volunteered at science museums, and balanced part-time workâ€”all
                of which have sharpened my teamwork and communication skills.
                When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies, staying
                active, and engaging with the community. Whether it's building
                intuitive applications or tackling complex problems, I'm driven
                by curiosity, adaptability, and a relentless commitment to
                growth.
